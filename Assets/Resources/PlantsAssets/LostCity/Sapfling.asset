  plantDescription: You've gotta see Sap-fling's throwing arm to believe it. He may
    be young, but everyone agrees ... the kid's got TALENT. Scouts from some of the
    biggest Pinecone Ball teams have been keeping a close eye on him. He could be
    headed to the majors. Oh sure, some knock him for his incredibly sticky spitball.
    But he only uses all-natural sap, so it's entirely legal.
