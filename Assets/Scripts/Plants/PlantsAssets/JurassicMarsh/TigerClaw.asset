  plantDescription: Long ago Tiger Claw used to be able to fire out his claw hand
    and retract it at will. However, due to unforseen circumstances, his claw no
    longer functions like this. Since then, Tiger Claw has been practicing boxing
    with his right hand, the boxing technique he finally mastered he likes to call
    the "Tomato Scrambled Eggs" punch.
