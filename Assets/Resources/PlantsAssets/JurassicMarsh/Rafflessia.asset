  plantDescription: 'Rafflesia is one of the park employees that children love the
    most. He is always surrounded by children wherever he is. He enjoys such a feeling.
    "I''m the best at blowing bubbles, and the kids love it!" He always says so as
    an introduction to others. Unbeknownst to him when they are giving a nod and
    a smile, most of them are confused: Isn''t he a balloon seller?'
